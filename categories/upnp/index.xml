      <description>This post deals with recent observations regarding UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) protocol &amp;amp; Routers. In few words, thanks to this protocol, devices (such as file sharing services, games, ..) can be easily connected/deployed.
First, I started to do research on my box to find relevant UPnP functionalities by hand, found some but I had trouble to exploit them. Few days ago, David Middlehurst released a tool called &amp;ldquo;UPnP Pentest Toolkit&amp;rdquo;.</description>
