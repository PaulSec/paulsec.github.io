      <description>Hey there,
Following my serie of write-ups for the BSidesCBR challs, I will discuss the DerpChat one.
The instructions for this challenge were:
This web-based challenge was worth 275 points. Run docker-compose up and then browse to https://web.shell.dance:4443/. After browsing to https://web.shell.dance:4443/, I arrived on a registration/login page. I registered the account test/test and I finally got a page with two inputs: – One too search some messages I suppose – And one in the middle of the page stating: “Hello, could you please send me the link I was after?</description>

      <description>Hello everyone!
Such a long time since I didn’t post any article. Here is a quick write-up for the BSidesCBR Cryto challenge for “needleinahaystack”.
Before diving in the challenge, huge props to all the organizers and OJ for making those challs available to everyone with Docker containers and stuff (more write-ups coming soon).
If you guys want to give it a shot, here you go, all challs are available here. The challenge we will discuss in this post (needleinahaystack) is located here.</description>

      <description>This has been some long time I haven&#39;t written another write-up. This one&#39;s for Kioptrix 3 that you can find here.
Host Discovery $ nmap -sP 192.168.56.1/24 and we got the IP address : 192.168.56.101.
As it was explained, you need to add 192.168.56.101 kioptrix3.com in your /etc/hosts.
Fingerprinting Then, let&#39;s find what kind of services are running on the host machine.
$ nmap 192.168.56.101 -sV -A Starting Nmap 6.46 ( http://nmap.</description>

Host discovery As always, we need to discover where the machine is on our network. To do so, let&#39;s use Nmap:
nmap -sP 192.168.1.1/24 Fingerprinting After getting the IP address (192.168.1.10), we need to do some fingerprinting.
nmap -sV 192.168.1.10 Fig. Nmap scan result
A lot of services were open, such as: VNC, FTP, etc.
As I saw it in the scan report, I decided to scan the port 80 with Nikto.</description>

This VM can he found here. Have a look to find even more VMs. But before starting the report, I&#39;d like to congratulate g0tmi1k for his awesome tool : VulnInjector.
Ok, let&#39;s do this write-up !

      <description>Hey there,
Quick blog post for the first VM I created to experiment some of your pentesting skills.
The idea grew up when I developed some security tools (especially the one (CSRFT) I presented at BSides London few weeks ago) to create a legal environment where you could try it out.
I really liked creating this Boot2root VM. So, I&#39;ll create few more that will rely on each other so keep the flags because you&#39;ll need it for the next ones.</description>

      <description>This blog post will be quite fast and will provide you the steps to update the OpenFuck exploit.
This exploit is pretty old but you might need it if you have fun with some vulnerable VMs. Not giving any hint. :-)
Thanks to this blog, I&#39;ve been able to update the exploit.
Here are the steps to make this work :
 1) Add those headers :  #include &amp;lt;openssl/rc4.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;openssl/md5.</description>

      <description>This contains the solution of the VM: VulnOS.
This is my first write-up for a VM and I&#39;m doing it for VulnOS which is hosted on VulnHub (Great resource if you want to improve your pentesting skills).
In this &amp;lsquo;tutorial&amp;rsquo;, I&#39;m gonna give you the steps I reproduced to get a shell on the machine.
Discovery First, start by scanning the network to discover where&#39;s the host.
nmap -sV 192.168.56.1/24 Starting Nmap 6.</description>
