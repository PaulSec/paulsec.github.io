        Incident clustering, also known as event clustering or anomaly clustering, is a technique used in data analysis and machine learning to group similar incidents or events together based on their characteristics or patterns.
In order to deep dive into this, we used sklearn and matplotlib to both do machine learning and visualize results in an easy way. In few words:
Scikit-learn is a powerful and popular open-source machine learning library in Python.

        This article aims at providing you some insights about the experience I had in the &ldquo;infosec world&rdquo; for the past few years. I had an amazing journey and grateful for everything that happened. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong with the title, even if the road was sometimes &ldquo;bumpy&rdquo; (aka &lsquo;bad&rsquo; experiences), I got some good lessons learnt through them and live by them. I am not trying to convince anyone with this article, except just do what&rsquo;s good for you and preserve yourself.

        Hi everyone!
Here is a pretty quick blog post on some Frida/Objection things I&rsquo;ve been tinkering with.
I had this Android application which had premium features and wanted to understand how that mechanism worked and if it was robust enough. Let&rsquo;s see what was the journey on how I&rsquo;ve bypassed it using Frida.
After disassembling the application with Jadx, I was able to perform a simple grep -r -i 'premium' .

        &ldquo;DevOps&rdquo; movement started &ldquo;publicly&rdquo; (first time we heard this term) circa 2007. Based on that, we (you?) might think that in 2021 that thing is utterly oudated but I totally disagree and I thought I would share some thoughts about DevOps in 2021, and what it means in real life.
I am quite uncomfortable using the word &ldquo;DevOps&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m serious. I guess it&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re putting so many things behind it and I feel we might have lost track of the real sense behind that term - &ldquo;DevOps&rdquo;.

        Hi everyone!
This article aims at providing you survival steps while tinkering around with Smali &amp; Android applications. The name of the original application I did my search on will remain secret but I created a dummy application doing the same so that you can do it on your own. The link of the MainActivity.java and MainActivity.smali is here
Create a dummy application with Android Studio and just import this. PLACEHOLDER_* strings will have to be replaced with proper ones if you want to try.

        While developing/maintaining the WHID Mobile Injector app, it turns out that I received messages and issues on Github telling me that users were:
Able to access the ESPloit interface through the browser but not through the app and the toggle in the side-menu was staying RED (meaning it is unable to connect to the ESPloit interface). Weird.
After some investigations, I was able to reproduce the issue on some phones at home, and while looking at logcat, I saw some strange lines like this:

        Hey everyone,
I will talk about some experiments I did with FastAPI and deploying on Zeit.co.
Context: For one side-project, I needed a simple way to retrieve the information from a specific Android application (eg. io.shodan.app) on the Google Store and a download link from APKPure (if any).
I thought that this would have been a great playground to get my hands on FastAPI, a very promising framework that I never had time to play with.

        Hi everyone,
Here is a small blog post where I needed to work on an Ionic v5 project where (Angular) events were/are not working anymore.
Context: Basically, I was working on the side-menu &lsquo;starter&rsquo; where I wanted the side-menu to automatically update with the user&rsquo;s username after logging in.
Beforehand, in order to use the Events, it was as simple as:
import { Events } from &#39;@ionic/angular&#39;; And finally work on your logic, but this got removed in Ionic 5.

Here is a small blog post regarding Kafka experiments and &ldquo;foundations&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve started working on. I will also take the opportunity to thank Maxence S. (https://twitter.com/maxenceschmitt) for his precious help on this topic.

        Hi everyone,
Here is a small article on how I successfully deployed my Django application through Github actions. Basically, what I needed was pretty simple, as soon as I push a new commit (on master), I want to:
connect through SSH on my remote server restart my cfptime service (which will do all the magic) My cfptime.org project is something like ~3 years old and at the beginning, I was deploying by hand and I created a bash script in order to ease this part and this is what it looked like:
