        Hello everyone,
Here is a small article in order to explain you how I&rsquo;ve deployed my Angular front-end to a server with Github actions.
Context: You might know that I am the developer behind cfptime.org and I&rsquo;ve had the chance during the holidays to start re-developing the front-end using Angular. If you want to check what it looks like: https://beta.cfptime.org.
I&rsquo;ve longer been a CircleCI user but it seems that the free plan is not enough in order to build my Angular project (and trust me, it&rsquo;s nothing ground-breaking, just couple of API calls and that&rsquo;s it).

        Time to relieve this blog and I think that a review of the Corelan Bootcamp training is the perfect occasion! I had in mind to try the OSCE certification and I felt I needed to go beyond just basic buffer overflows that you might come by with OSCP for example.
I&rsquo;ve had the chance to attend this training at Hack in Paris in June 2018 and I will try to give as much insights as I can without telling too much (because of NDA).

        Hey there,
Following my serie of write-ups for the BSidesCBR challs, I will discuss the DerpChat one.
The instructions for this challenge were:
This web-based challenge was worth 275 points. Run docker-compose up and then browse to https://web.shell.dance:4443/. After browsing to https://web.shell.dance:4443/, I arrived on a registration/login page. I registered the account test/test and I finally got a page with two inputs: – One too search some messages I suppose – And one in the middle of the page stating: “Hello, could you please send me the link I was after?

        Hello everyone!
Such a long time since I didn’t post any article. Here is a quick write-up for the BSidesCBR Cryto challenge for “needleinahaystack”.
Before diving in the challenge, huge props to all the organizers and OJ for making those challs available to everyone with Docker containers and stuff (more write-ups coming soon).
If you guys want to give it a shot, here you go, all challs are available here. The challenge we will discuss in this post (needleinahaystack) is located here.

        After analyzing the HTTP Security Headers from the top 10k Alexa websites, I decided looking at the SSL Ciphers used on those websites.
These results are coming from a scan on port 443 for all those domains. Only 4715 servers replied.
The OpenSSL version installed on my server did not support SSLv2 so SSLv2 ciphers have not been detected.
Here are the results:

        This post deals with recent observations regarding UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) protocol &amp; Routers. In few words, thanks to this protocol, devices (such as file sharing services, games, ..) can be easily connected/deployed.
First, I started to do research on my box to find relevant UPnP functionalities by hand, found some but I had trouble to exploit them. Few days ago, David Middlehurst released a tool called &ldquo;UPnP Pentest Toolkit&rdquo;.

        This has been some long time I haven&rsquo;t written another write-up. This one&rsquo;s for Kioptrix 3 that you can find here.
Host Discovery $ nmap -sP 192.168.56.1/24 and we got the IP address : 192.168.56.101.
As it was explained, you need to add 192.168.56.101 kioptrix3.com in your /etc/hosts.
Fingerprinting Then, let&rsquo;s find what kind of services are running on the host machine.
$ nmap 192.168.56.101 -sV -A Starting Nmap 6.46 ( http://nmap.

        Hi there, this post deals with the game released by Google few days ago about XSS vulnerabilities that you can find here.
I&rsquo;ll enumerate some of the solution I found on the Internet which were (in my opnion) interesting/fun. This post contains the solutions for all levels. Big spoil.
Level 1: Hello, world of XSS Well, this one was obvious:
&lt;script&gt;alert(1);&lt;/script&gt; Level 2: Persistence is key For this one, you had different options:

        Hi there,
Quick blog post on the VM &ldquo;Bobby&rdquo; which is once of the nicest VM I did so far.
Discovery The first step is always the same: discovering the machine on the network. To do so:
$ nmap -sV 192.168.1.1/24 I managed to retrieve the IP address: 192.168.1.11.
Let&rsquo;s start to fingerprint the different services to exploit it.
Fingerprinting Then, I used Nmap to retrieve the services running:
$ nmap -sV 192.

Hi there,
This blog post deals with HTTP Security Headers on top 10k Alexa websites. Based on this discussion on netsec, I decided to do some statistics on Alexa ranking.
To do this study, I did a GET HTTP Request and saved the headers in the HTTP response. This has been done using Python.
First of all, I scanned 10000 hosts. 555 hosts didn&rsquo;t respond so those statistics are based on 9445 hosts.
